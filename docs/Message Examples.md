Gold M5-M15 ✅✅✅

price is moving sideways in short time frame, waiting for clearer confirmation for scalping signal with you guys, are you ready to trade with me? 🔥🔥🔥]


[📊 Gold extends its record-breaking rally, approaching the key psychological level of $3,150, as investors await the U.S. announcement of "reciprocal tariffs" on April 2. 

📊 Renewed trade tensions, fueled by President Trump's decision to impose broader tariffs rather than a targeted approach, have triggered fresh USD weakness, further strengthening gold's appeal.

📊 Concerns over the potential economic fallout, including the risk of U.S. stagflation, have intensified expectations for aggressive Federal Reserve rate cuts. Meanwhile, robust central bank purchases and rising ETF inflows continue to support gold’s upward momentum.

📊 However, as markets brace for heightened volatility following the tariff announcement, traders may look to adjust their positions. 

📊 Profit-taking and key economic data releases could prompt a temporary pullback, though gold remains on track for its strongest quarterly performance since 1986.]

We have identified the 3039-3045 zone as the target once the 3127 resistance is broken. This is not a signal to sell gold—be mindful for more effective trades.
 • I will only sell when there is confirmation of a peak formation, a bearish engulfing candle, and strong selling liquidity intervention.]

[Gold Buy running 400 pips from yesterday’s absolute precision analysis:
 • Identified the strong liquidity zone at 3100
 • Pinpointed the exact entry at 3100
 • Marked the breakout zone at 3112 and the retracement to 3100 upon the break
 • Precisely identified 3139 as the target after breaking the 3127 resistance

The result? Absolute profit! 🙏]
