# Progress Log

This document tracks major milestones, completed tasks, and ongoing work.

---

### [2025-04-10 15:14:00] - Memory Bank Initialized
- Created structured documentation files for product context, active context, system patterns, decision log, and progress tracking.

### [2025-04-10 15:14:10] - Documentation Analysis Completed
- Thoroughly reviewed PRD, Trading Logic, Code Summary, and Message Examples.
- Extracted goals, architecture, decision logic, and parsing requirements.

### [2025-04-10 15:14:20] - Populated Memory Bank with Project Context
- Filled product context with goals, scope, architecture, and assumptions.
- Documented system patterns including async design, modularity, LLM parsing, and decision logic.
- Logged key architectural and technical decisions.
- Captured current focus, recent changes, and open questions.

### [2025-04-10 15:14:30] - Next Steps
- Tune LLM prompts and decision logic weights.
- Implement and test end-to-end trade execution.
- Enhance error handling and update management.


### [2025-04-11 16:54:00] - Debugged and Standardized Pip-Based Trade Logic
- Traced and fixed all code related to AutoSL, AutoTP, Trailing Stop, Entry price calculations, and AutoBE to ensure consistent pip-based logic.
- Fixed bugs in SL calculation, entry price adjustment, and initial AutoSL application.
- Updated configuration and config service for pip-based offsets.
- Added and updated unit tests for all affected functions and scenarios (BUY/SELL, edge cases).
- Documented all changes and findings in the Memory Bank.
- Plan for future features like risk-based sizing and multi-symbol support.

### [2025-04-11 17:10:50] - Full Codebase Inspection and Debug Complete
- Inspected all core modules (trade_calculator, trade_manager, mt5_executor, event_processor, config_service, etc.) for pip-based logic, config usage, and error handling.
- Verified that all SL, TP, BE, TSL, and entry price calculations use pip-based config values and correct symbol info.
- Confirmed that spread and offset are consistently handled in BE and TSL logic.
- Reviewed and ran all unit tests for pip-based trade management; all critical paths and edge cases are covered.
- No inconsistencies or legacy USD-based logic remain. All config keys and code paths are pip-standardized.
- Memory Bank and documentation updated to reflect the current robust, pip-based system.

### [2025-04-13 05:55:33] - Enhanced Test Coverage and Fixed Related Bugs
- Added new unit tests for `DistributedLimitsStrategy` in `tests/test_trade_execution_strategies.py`, focusing on dependency interactions.
- Added new unit tests for `StateManager` in `tests/test_state_manager.py`, covering trade state management and MT5 sync logic.
- Added new integration test `test_process_multiple_signals` in `tests/test_workflows.py` to simulate end-to-end signal processing (valid, invalid, duplicate).
- Debugged and fixed issues identified during testing:
    - Corrected mock configuration (`max_total_lots`) in `test_workflows.py` causing `TypeError`.
    - Fixed `NameError` for `tp_assignment_config` in `src/event_processor.py` by loading config correctly.
    - Added missing duplicate check logic at the start of `process_new_signal` in `src/event_processor.py`.
    - Corrected `mt5_executor` mock return structure in `test_workflows.py` to simulate successful trades and allow `StateManager` updates.
- All tests, including the new workflow test, now pass.

### [2025-04-13 21:38] - Refactored TP Assignment System and Added Tests
- Refactored `src/tp_assignment.py` to support only `none`, `first_tp_first_trade`, and `custom_mapping` modes, removing obsolete strategies.
- Updated `src/event_processor.py` and `src/trade_execution_strategies.py` to use the simplified TP system.
- Added `[TPAssignment]` section with documentation to `config/example-config.ini`.
- Rewrote `tests/test_tp_assignment.py` with comprehensive unit tests for the new TP modes.
- Created `tests/test_trade_execution_integration.py` with advanced integration tests simulating realistic signal-to-trade scenarios, including TP assignment and entry/SL adjustments.
- Updated Memory Bank (`systemPatterns.md`, `decisionLog.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) to reflect all changes.
